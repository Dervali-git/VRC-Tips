**Placing objects on a bone that is effected by a Dynamic Bone Script in Unity**

For this example we are placing a glow stick on the ear of an avali. 

So on the Dynamic Bone script on the ear, click on the drop down next to "Exclusions" and set the size to the number of objects on the ear, in this case 1. Then in Element box that appears below select the object on the ear. You can click and drag it over from the hierarchy on the left, or click on the circle next to the box and find it in the list.

If you just place an object on a bone that is moved my a dynamic bone script without an exclusion, it will move further than it's parent.
