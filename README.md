Substance Painter Color Conversion     
>Substance painter is linear RGB (values from 0-1) vs 8-bit sRGB that we are all used to (values from 0-255)
This calculator can do exact 8-bit sRGB to linear conversions (you enter 0-255 values on the first line and read results on the third line to put into Substance Painter) : http://davengrace.com/dave/cspace/
